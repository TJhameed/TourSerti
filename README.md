# TourSerti
This project is intentionally developed to help tourists who visit the Gashaka Gumti National Park and are in need to tour round it's host town (Serti). The project is meant to help them navigate through the town without needing the services of a human tour guide. Which will ultimately save them the cost of hiring a human tour guide.
